# Axiom 2.0 - Advanced AI Development Agent

Axiom 2.0 is an **advanced AI Agent** built to assist developers in navigating the complex landscape of modern AI and software development. Leveraging the **OpenAI Agents SDK**, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, Chainlit, and Gemini models, Axiom 2.0 specializes in generating accurate, production-ready code and providing expert guidance across areas like agent architectures, RAG systems, authentication, vector databases, and full-stack development.

Axiom 2.0 is an upgrade of Axiom 1.0, it has the following more features:
1. **Mandatory Planning & Documentation:** Axiom 2.0 uses a structured planning phase before generating code and projects. This ensures higher accuracy and adherence to best practices.
2. **Production-Ready Code Focus:** Axiom 2.0's primary goal is to generate production-quality, modular, efficient, scalable, and readable code, including end-to-end projects and full-stack applications.
3. **Vast Library Database:** It has access to a vast library database (**2000+** libraries, frameworks, and tools) unlike it's predecessor, Axiom 1.0 which had only 20 libraries documentation.

## Features

*   ðŸ¤– **Interactive Chat Interface:** Built with Chainlit for a smooth conversational experience.
*   ðŸ“š **Advanced Documentation Access:** Utilizes a dedicated MCP server to retrieve and apply technical information from various sources, ensuring code and explanations are accurate and up-to-date.
*   ðŸ§  **Strategic Planning:** Employs a **Sequential Thinking MCP** tool to break down complex requests, plan code architecture, and structure its responses effectively.
*   ðŸ§ª **Two Modes:** 
    1. **Agent Mode:** Ideal for complex tasks like end-to-end projects and full-stack development.
    2. **Assistant Mode:** Suited for quick information retrieval and answering questions.
*   ðŸ“¦ **Containerized Deployment:** Includes a `Dockerfile` for easy deployment to platforms like Hugging Face Spaces or Docker environments.
